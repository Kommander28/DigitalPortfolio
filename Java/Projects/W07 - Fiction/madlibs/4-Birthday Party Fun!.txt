Yesterday I went to 
{PERSONS NAME}'s birthday party. I got him/her a 
{NOUN}. The party was 
{ADJECTIVE}. We started by playing 
{ACTIVITY} and then there was a 
{VERB} party. Lots of my friends were there but I mostly hung out with 
{PERSONS NAME}. We talked about 
{NOUN} and how our friend 
{PERSONS NAME} is a 
{NOUN}. During cake everyone 
{PAST TENSE VERB} and sang 
{SONG NAME}. I had a 
{ADJECTIVE} time at the party and enjoyed celebrating 
{PERSONS NAME}. He/she is such a 
{ADJECTIVE} friend.
