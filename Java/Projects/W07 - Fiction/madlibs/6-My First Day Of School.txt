Today was my first day of 
{NUMBER 1-8} grade. My teacher is Ms. 
{FEMALE NAME}. She seems 
{ADJECTIVE} and 
{ADJECTIVE}. I think her class will be pretty 
{ADJECTIVE}. My friends 
{NOUN} and 
{NOUN} are also in my class. We messed around during class by hiding 
{NOUN} in peoples' 
{PLURAL NOUN} and asking questions about 
{NOUN}. The teacher got really 
{ADJECTIVE} at us and told us that we have to go to the 
{NOUN}. This just made us 
{VERB} more. It was a 
{ADJECTIVE} first day of school!
