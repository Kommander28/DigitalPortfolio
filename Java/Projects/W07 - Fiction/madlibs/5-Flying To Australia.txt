I decided to go on a vacation to Australia with 
{NOUN}. We got to the airport 
{NUMBER} hours early. When we went through security, I got stopped because I forgot to take 
{NOUN} out of my pocket. We got some 
{FOOD} for the flight and arrived at the gate. Once we boarded the plane, I was sitting next to a very 
{ADJECTIVE} man. He spent the entire flight 
{VERB} and talking about his job doing 
{WORK}. Whenever I tried to sleep, he would step around me to go to the 
{NOUN}. I was so 
{ADJECTIVE}. Since I couldn't sleep, I decided to 
{VERB} and 
{VERB} instead. Finally, we arrived in Australia. All in all, the flight was 
{ADJECTIVE}!
